Welcome to the GPT-4o Labs samples using C#. This repository contains a demo projects that showcases how to integrate the powerful GPT-4o model with the new OpenAI Library for .NET and Semantic Kernel in a .NET environment.

## Prerequisites

Before running the sample, ensure you have the following installed:
- **.NET 8**: Make sure you have the latest version of .NET installed on your machine.
- **(Optional) OpenAI Key**: An OpenAI API key is required to authenticate and interact with the GPT-4o model.
- **(Optional) Azure OpenAI Services**: A GPT-4o model deployed in [Azure OpenAI Services](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/overview?WT.mc_id=academic-00000-brunocapuano).
- **(Optional) Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code**: You will need an IDE or code editor capable of running .NET projects. Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code are recommended.

## About the Samples

The following samples demonstrates differnet capabilities of the GPT-4o model, in example: analyzing and describing an image. The samples uses the official OpenAI library for .NET and Semantic Kernel to process the image and generate a description using C#.

Here is the list of projects:

### OpenAI APIs

| Category | Name | Description | Source |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Semantic Kernel | GPT4o_lab01 | Chat sample analizing an image from a URL | `.\src\GPT4o_lab01` |
| Semantic Kernel | GPT4o_lab02 | Audio to text sample | `.\src\GPT4o_lab02` |
| OpenAI library for .NET | OAINETSDK_lab01 | Chat sample asking questions to `GPT-4o` | `.\src\OAINETSDK_lab01` |
| OpenAI library for .NET | OAINETSDK_lab02 | Audio to text using `Whisper-1` | `.\src\OAINETSDK_lab02` |
| OpenAI library for .NET | OAINETSDK_lab03 | Chat sample analizing an image from a local file with `GPT-4o` | `.\src\OAINETSDK_lab03` |

### Azure OpenAI Services


| Category | Name | Description | Source |
|------|------|-------------|--------|
| Semantic Kernel | GPT4o_AOAI_lab01 | Chat sample analizing an image from a URL | `.\src\GPT4o_AOAI_lab01` |
| Semantic Kernel | GPT4o_AOAI_lab02 | Upload an image to an Azure Blob and then analizes the image from the blob URL. | `.\src\GPT4o_AOAI_lab02` |


## Example: How to Run the Project

To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
1. Open a terminal and enter your OpenAI Key with the following commands 

    ```bash
    cd .\src\GPT4o_lab01\

    # init projecs user-secrets
    dotnet user-secrets init

    # add OpenAI API Key
    dotnet user-secrets set "APIKEY" "OpenAI API KEY"
    ```

1. Run the project with the command

    ```bash
    dotnet run
    ```

1.  The current project analyzes this image

    ![Ultra running mug](/imgs/ultrarunningmug.png)

1. You should see an output similar to this one:

    *The image shows a person holding a mug that has the text "Ultrarunning (verb) the art of running as far as you can, and then running another 20 miles." In the background, there is a scenic view of trees and lush greenery, along with an outdoor swimming pool surrounded by a paved deck with lounge chairs. Additionally, a dog is partially visible near the bottom right of the image, standing near the railing. The scene appears to be tranquil and picturesque, likely taking place in a backyard or a similar outdoor setting.*
